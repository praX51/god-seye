# God's Eye — Landing site (scaffold)

World-class, ultra-modern Next.js + Tailwind scaffold for the "God's Eye" AI security platform.

## What I built for you
- Next.js 14 (app router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with dark theme + glassmorphism
- Framer Motion micro-animations
- Three.js 3D hero (AI eye) via @react-three/fiber
- Lenis smooth scrolling
- Responsive, SEO-ready landing sections per your spec

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies
   - npm install
2. Run dev server
   - npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Replace logo / assets
- Drop your logo at `public/assets/logo.png` (or `logo.svg`) — the navbar will use `/assets/logo.svg` by default.

## Founder & CTA
- Founder: **Poojan Aghera — God of Hackers** (already added)
- Demo email used in CTAs: **agherapoojan333@gmail.com**

## Notes & next steps
- 3D hero is lazy-loaded and GPU-friendly. Replace or extend the model in `components/Hero3D.tsx`.
- Add your brand assets and copy in `app/page.tsx` and `components/*`.
- I can add animations, A11y fixes, forms, or integrate a CMS / API next — tell me which next.

Enjoy — run `npm run dev` and tell me what to tweak (copy, colors, animations, or an investor pitch page).
